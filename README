# Trollcam.py

A fake MJPEG camera stream. Loads the "cam.jpg" file and attempts to make it
"webcammy".  It implements a basic day/night cycle and fake auto-gain spazzes

Serves this on its own HTTP server on port 8080, though you can get it to use
a different port by passing --port X.

./Trollcam.py --port 9000

Remember that on Linux you won't be able to use ports <1024 without some extra
work.

TROLLOLOLOLOLOL!!
