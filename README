# Trollcam.py

A fake MJPEG camera stream. Loads the "cam.jpg" file and attempts to make it
"webcammy".

Serves this on its own http server on port 8080, though you can get it to use
a different port by passing --port.  Remember that on Linux you won't be able
to use ports <1024 without some extra work.

Implements a basic day/night cycle and fake auto-gain spazzes

TROLLOLOLOLOLOL!!
